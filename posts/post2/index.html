  <meta property="og:description" content="I realized that as long as github &amp; bandcamp are up and running, these posts will be out there, in the ether of web2. Are we still in web2? I forget. Also, wasn’t web3 NFTs? How are those pictures doing these days? Worth millions orrrrrr… I don’t think I should be living inside other people’s dreams, yet I evidently have taken up residence in them.
Oh, look at mr. big words. “You must think you’re better than me.” I guess I’m gonna start hearing that more if I ever leave the house and start having conversations with strangers again.
I like typing. It feels good to type fast.
I’m typing all this up in that black window with the green text that some folks call “The Terminal” or “The Command Line” and even “the CLI.” I want this to impress someone other than me but me is enough. nano not vim lol c’mon be serious.
So how did I use Ai in this post? Well, there’s that silly picture up there. I only generate images locally, using my computer and stable diffusion or flux models. I think there’s a new model that’s fully trained on public domain images and not art but I haven’t figured that one out yet.
Why am I making this blog? I just wanted to see if I could publish some kind of website. So now I have to at least add some content to it.
Oh, btw, if u hate Ai check out this link to “a comprehensive index of real issues, misconceptions, and cognitive fallacies in Ai discussions.&#34; [“a comprehensive index of real issues, misconceptions, and cognitive fallacies in Ai discussions.”]">
